/**
 * `useAnimate` wrapper whose returned `animate` never settles as a rejected
 * promise.
 *
 * motion rejects an animation's promise when it is interrupted — e.g. hovering
 * out cancels the in-flight hover-in animation. Our animated icons
 * `await animate(...)` inside async hover handlers wired straight to
 * `onHoverStart` / `onHoverEnd`, so that rejection had nothing catching it. On
 * Safari it surfaced as an unhandled `DOMException: InvalidStateError` that
 * PostHog error tracking captured (issue: web, Mobile Safari, no stack trace).
 *
 * Swallowing the interruption rejection here fixes every animated icon in one
 * place. The icons only ever `await` the result, so collapsing it to a
 * never-rejecting promise is behaviourally transparent.
 *
 * The return type is intentionally left to inference so `scope` keeps the same
 * loose element type as a bare `useAnimate()` call — the icons attach it to
 * both `motion.svg` and `motion.div` refs.
