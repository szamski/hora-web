Every macOS user who relies on Google Calendar knows the pain. You either use the web app, deal with CalDAV sync issues in Apple Calendar, or install an Electron-based app that eats your RAM for breakfast.

I wanted something different — a **native, fast, beautiful** Google Calendar client that feels like it belongs on macOS.

## The Problem with Existing Solutions

**Apple Calendar + CalDAV** works, but the sync is unreliable. Events appear late, recurring events break, and you lose Google-specific features like Google Meet integration and guest permissions.

**Electron apps** (Fantastical, Notion Calendar) are functional but heavy. They're essentially Chrome tabs pretending to be native apps. On a MacBook Air, you notice.

**The web app** is… fine. But it doesn't integrate with macOS notifications, keyboard shortcuts, or the menu bar. And switching between browser tabs to check your schedule gets old.

## The hora Approach

hora talks directly to the **Google Calendar REST API** — no CalDAV middleware, no translation layer. What you see is exactly what's on Google's servers.

It's built with:
- **Swift 6 + SwiftUI** — truly native, truly fast
- **SwiftData** for local caching — your calendar works offline
- **Incremental sync** — only fetches what changed since last sync
- **Optimistic UI** — changes feel instant, syncs in the background

## What's Next

I'm working toward an initial release on the Mac App Store and TestFlight. Follow the progress on [X](https://x.com/moto_szama) or star the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/szamski/hora-web).
