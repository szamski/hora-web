[Last week I published a help-wanted post](/blog/2026-04-08-swiftui-appearance-bug/) about hora Calendar's appearance switching. Light/Dark/Auto toggle in Settings, `@AppStorage`, `.preferredColorScheme()` — textbook setup, and the main window wouldn't update until you defocused Settings. Two full days of approaches that didn't work.

A few people wrote in. The suggestions were good. None of them turned out to be *the* cause — but reading them made me look at the problem from a different angle, and that's what cracked it.

Turns out I was blaming the wrong API. `.preferredColorScheme` was mostly fine. The culprits were three unrelated things stacked on top of each other.

## Cause 1: a glass modifier was swallowing appearance propagation

hora has a subtle "inspector glass" effect on the right sidebar — an `InspectorGlassContext` modifier that sets the material state. I'd left it at:

```swift
.environment(\.inspectorGlassContext, InspectorGlassContext(state: .active))
```

That `state: .active` line was the first problem. When the glass context is forced active, it pins the resolved appearance at the moment the view mounts and doesn't re-resolve when `ColorScheme` changes propagate through the environment. The sidebar stayed in its original scheme until the window redrew from scratch — which on macOS happens on focus change.

Removing the forced state was the single biggest win. The sidebar started tracking appearance correctly for the first time.

## Cause 2: `Color(NSColor)` vs. SwiftUI's shape styles

Scattered across the app I had things like:

```swift
.background(Color(NSColor.windowBackgroundColor))
.overlay(Rectangle().fill(Color(NSColor.separatorColor)))
```

These look right. They even *are* right on first render. But `Color(NSColor.windowBackgroundColor)` resolves the color once, at the moment the `Color` value is constructed, against whatever `NSAppearance` is current on that thread. It's captured. When SwiftUI later pushes a new `ColorScheme` through the environment, the captured `Color` doesn't re-resolve.

The fix is to use SwiftUI's native shape styles, which *are* environment-aware:

```swift
.background(.windowBackground)
.overlay(Rectangle().fill(.separator))
```

I replaced every `Color(NSColor.*)` in the view layer. Backgrounds, separators, dashed borders for pending invitations, capsule badges. Tedious. But after this, most surfaces started updating live.

## Cause 3: never pass `nil` to `.preferredColorScheme()`

This is the one I should have caught earlier. The original code:

```swift
enum AppearanceMode: String, CaseIterable {
    case auto, light, dark

    var colorScheme: ColorScheme? {
        switch self {
        case .auto:  return nil     // ← the trap
        case .light: return .light
        case .dark:  return .dark
        }
    }
}

// Applied as:
.preferredColorScheme(appearanceMode.colorScheme)
```

Passing `nil` to `.preferredColorScheme()` means "defer to the system appearance." That's the documented behavior, and it works on *first* application. But transitioning from an explicit value (`.light` or `.dark`) *back* to `nil` doesn't trigger an immediate redraw on macOS. The environment updates, but the window doesn't pick it up until its next draw cycle — which, again, happens on focus change.

Fix: always pass an explicit `ColorScheme`. Never `nil`. For Auto mode, resolve the system appearance ourselves:

```swift
@State private var systemIsDark = NSApp.effectiveAppearance
    .bestMatch(from: [.darkAqua, .aqua]) == .darkAqua

private var resolvedColorScheme: ColorScheme {
    switch appearanceMode {
    case .auto:  return systemIsDark ? .dark : .light
    case .light: return .light
    case .dark:  return .dark
    }
}

var body: some View {
    // ...
    .preferredColorScheme(resolvedColorScheme)
    .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(
        for: NSApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification)) { _ in
        updateSystemAppearance()
    }
    .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(
        for: NSApplication.didChangeScreenParametersNotification)) { _ in
        updateSystemAppearance()
    }
}

private func updateSystemAppearance() {
    let isDark = NSApp.effectiveAppearance
        .bestMatch(from: [.darkAqua, .aqua]) == .darkAqua
    if systemIsDark != isDark {
        systemIsDark = isDark
    }
}
```

Two things to note:

- The Settings scene needs this too, independently. Each `Scene` with its own `.preferredColorScheme()` modifier needs its own resolver. I initially applied the fix only to `ContentView` and wondered why Settings still froze.
- The `NSApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification` observer is what makes Auto mode follow the system when macOS itself switches at sunset. Without it, the app would only re-resolve on launch.

## The combined effect

Each of these three things alone would have produced a subtler version of the same symptom. Stacked, they produced the exact behaviour in the original post: setting updates, environment updates, 0.38ms propagation — and the window just sitting there until you clicked elsewhere.

</video>

After the fix, toggling Light → Dark → Auto updates every window instantly, including Settings while it's open.

The debug test I wrote for the first post is still in the suite, renamed. It now passes on non-key windows, which is the thing I couldn't achieve two weeks ago.

## The meta-lesson

I spent two days convinced the bug was inside `.preferredColorScheme()`. It wasn't. The modifier was doing exactly what it's documented to do. The bug was three unrelated things that each made the system *look* like `.preferredColorScheme()` was broken.

"The obvious suspect is innocent" is one of the more annoying shapes a bug can take. But writing the public help-wanted post forced me to spell out every assumption in the diagnostic — and when I sat down to do that a second time, the `nil` in `var colorScheme: ColorScheme?` suddenly looked different.

Thank you to everyone who wrote in.
